# pandas_challenge

I am now much happier with the analysis of these school data.  This is my 2nd submission, as I encountered some mistakes near the deadline and needed to return to the project.  I hope it can be rescored.

I believe that all of the analysis and calculation required is shown in the Finished PyCity Python file.

I went back to this project to make the code more efficient after having more experience with python and pandas.  The new "Revised" version is much cleaner.  Thanks to Kelli for helping me see that I could create multiple Data Series and then create DataFrames from these series with identical index values.
