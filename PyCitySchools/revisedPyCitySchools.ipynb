    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 15 total schools included in PyCity.  There are a total of 39,170 students, and the district total budget is about $25,650,000.  Eight of the 15 schools are charter schools.  All of the schools range in size of enrollment from 427 students on the low end, all the way up to 4,719 students.  All but 3 of the shools have enrollments greater than 1500 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Student Math and Reading scores were merged with data about the schools in order to do an analysis of the results.  One takeaway is that the Charter Schools generally have lower per student Budgets.  In addition, the highest performing schools, in terms of percent of students passing both math and reading, were all Charter schools. The bottom 5 performing schools were all District schools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing bins of spending ranges to math and reading results showed that schools with the lowest per student budgets had higher rates of passing math and reading.  Schools that spent more per students had lower passing rates.  This seems counterintuitive.  One would think that spending more would likely help at least some schools to raise results well enough to positively affect the averages.  This may be partially explained by looking at the size of the schools.  Small and medium schools (less than 2000 students) had relatively higher passing rates and lower per student budgets.  Passing rates for large schools were quite a bit lower, and these schools, on average, have higher spending per student.  It seems that perhaps there is something about running a large school that requires more money and does not provide the same high achievement.\n",
